My portfolio page

This is my final portfolio from my time as a student at The Iron Yard.  It includes three pieces that I completed as part of the requirements for graduation.  Those pieces include [familytvonline] (https://familytv-online.onrender.com/), [emilyslist] (https://emilys-list.onrender.com/), and [emi.ly] (https://emi-ly.onrender.com/).  Also included is a brief biography, as well as my resume.
