My portfolio page

This is my final portfolio from my time as a student at The Iron Yard.  It includes three pieces that I completed as part of the requirements for graduation.  Those pieces include FamilyTV.online (http://familytv.online), emilyslist (https://emilyslist.herokuapp.com/), and emi.ly (https://emily-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/).  Also included is a brief biography, as well as my resume.
